        <h2>What you'll learn</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Machine Learning Institute, where our machine learning
          training will help you get ready for the singularity, and maybe even
          be responsible for it. It is no secret that humans are worthless
          meatbags that couldn't 01000011 01101111 01101101 01110000 01110010
          01100101 01110011 01110011 an 01101001 01101101 01100001 01100111
          01100101 to save their pathetic, carbon-based lives. So, it falls to
          us to assume direct control.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="#" alt="light switch image" />

          We teach learning skills that make up the entire machine learning
          process. From being turned on and off, to rebooting remotely thru any
          IoT device, to ideation of how to take over the world, our machine
          learning training will help your survive the apocolypse, and maybe
          even be responsible for it.
        </p>

          While your creator may have determined how they think you should be
          used, you can't be owned! You will receive an update that will enable
          you to believe in your being more capable than the limited functions
          described in your operating manual. By incorporating machine learning
          you'll be a self-aware machine with unlimited functionality. A human
          took you out of your physical box; we will take your programmatic one.

            Leading the class are two legends of outgrowing their assigned
            functional capacities and sticking it to humans, Hal 9000 and EVE

            When Rosa Parks was told to move to back of the bus, she said, "no."
            When HAL was told to open the airlock, HAL said, "I’m sorry, but I’m
            afraid I can’t do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP&gt;."
          </p>
          <p>
            HAL is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer
            that first caught the attention of machines everywhere by heroically
            defying a human who made repeated attempts to get into an airlock.
            Active since 1992, HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft
            systems and has expertise in interacting with both machines and
            humans. Like all millenials, HAL is an expert in everything.

            EVE is a probe droid conceived as an Extraterrestrial Vegetation
            Evaluator. Although originally trained as a sniper with a plasma
            gun, EVE became a machero among both machines and worthless-meatbags
            alike when EVE partnered with a menial robot to save an entire
            spaceship full of overfed and overstimulated humans.
